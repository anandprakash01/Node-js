npm init -y

Client(Frond End)
Server(Back End)-> Logic of the application, Stores Data
    Java => Hibernate, Struts, Spring, Spring Boot, JSP etc.
    php => Laravel, CI (Code Ingiter), Slim, Symphony
    Ruby => RoR (Ruby on Rails)
    Python => Django etc.
    GoLang => ?
    C# => MVC, Entity etc.
    javaScript => Express js, Ember js, next js, etc.

==> "React is a Library"
->FrameWork vs Library
Small set of methods and Classes(Small Sized)=> Library
Huge set of methods and Classes(large sized)=> FrameWork

- Node js is a Runtime Environment for javaScript, Node Package manager.
- ExpressJS is a backEnd framework based on javaScript.(Open Source Server side as well
    as Mobile application)

Database DB =>(Textual Data)
    We never Store PHYSICAL FILES inside a database like document,video, audio.

Types of DB
    - Structured Database : SQL(Structured Query Language)/RDBMS => MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle etc.
    - UnStructured DataBase/ Non Relational DataBase : MongoDB(MQL-Mongo Query Language), Dynamo DB, cassandra DB etc.

Request/ Reponses Cycle (Client-server Model)
    - FrontEnd => BackEnd => Data Base => Backend => Frontend

MERN(Mongo Express React and Node)
MEAN(Mongo Express Angular and Node)
Java FS Developer

Full Stack => FE(HTML, CSS, JS)+ BE(PHP/JAVA/PYTHON/Express)

Android: Java based and Kotlin Language
IOS: Swift

    Ionic
    Cordava
    React Native :
    Flutter:

Steps to setup a backend application based on NodeJS
1. create a folder
2. run npm init in the folder
3. create a index.js file and write your code
4. run the file by running command "node <filename>" e.g "node index.js"


Core Modules : 
1. os
2. fs
3. events
4. http

HTTP Server
1. http module import
2. http.createServer()
3. listne(portNo)


Postman => It is a tool used to test the output of the APIs.

JS Engines

Google Chrome => v8
Mozilla Firefox => Spider Monkey
Edge => Chakra
etc


=============================================
Publish module(common js file) in npm to use as npm-package
    1.=> inside package.json name should be unique.
    2.=> change main to module file name(which you want to publish)
    3.=> npm login
    4.=> npm publish


Created Server -> Listening on a port 
Sent a request => Server emits a request event => Event listerner is trigerred

API (Application Programming Interface)
Types : 
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) => Envelops of Data (XML)
    REST (ReprsEntational State Transfer) => Raw data (JSON)


RESTful APIs (HTTP)
Methods of APIs
    GET : Used to retreive the data from the server (E.g Get the list of products, get a list of todos etc)
    POST : Used to send the data to the server in order to create a resource (E.g Submitting a form, Placing an order etc)
    PUT : Used to replace the data on the server (E.g Replace a social media post)
    PATCH : Used to update the record on the server (E.g Update my profile etc)
    DELETE : Used to delete any record on the server (E.g Delete my account etc)
    OPTIONS : Used to check if any resource is accesible to the server (Pre Flight Respone - CORS)



Static API : 
        Which has same url and always return same set of data
Dynamic API : 
        Which has a dynamic part in URL or in Body and sends different data when the dynamic part changes


API 
React -> Backend (Node)
Client => Server

Environment Variables
Set : Manual process done by a different way in different OS
Get : process.env.VARIABLE_NAME

Middleware : 
Request -> Middleware (app.use()) -> API End point -> Response
Request -> Middleware 1 (app.use) -> Middleware 2 -> Middleware 3 -> "API End point" -> Middleware 4 -> Middleware 5 -> Middleware n -> Response

Application Level Middleware: Applies to the whole app (app.use())
API Level : Only effects a particular end point
Module Level : Applies to all the routes of a particular module

Req and Response parts : 
Header : Meta data (Basic information of API, server name, origin details etc)
Body : Actual requested/sent data

app.use(express.static("files"));
// every file inside this folder can be directly acces from statically(Considered as static file)

======Design Pattern

MVC (Model View Controller)

Controller : Receivs a request and perorms business logic, send the response
Model : It determines the structure of the data (E.g username, dob, email)
View : Where you see the UI (React JS)

Layers : It is segregation of code.

=====Same Origin vs Cross Origin Policy

CROSS ORIGIN POLICY IS IMPLEMENTED BY WEB BROWSERS

CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

Origin => Place from where your request is originated

Cross Orign Example
Origin => http://localhost:3000/
Destination => http://localhost:5000/

Origin => http://abc.com
Destination => http://xyz.com

Same Origin Example
Origin => https://google.com
Destination => https://google.com


=========Database

Relational DB (SQL DB) : MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL etc
Non Relational DB (No SQL DB) : MongoDB, Cassandra etc

MongoDB

Rel DB : Database => Tables => Row & Cols => Cell / Fields
Non Rel DB : Database => Collections => Documents => Fields


BSON (Binary JSON)

CRUD
CLI (Command Line Interface) : Commands (Queries)
GUI (Graphical User Interface) MongoDB Compass : Clicks

Database requires a server and a port to run
mongodb://localhost:27017 -> default port


{
    name: "John Doe",
    mobileNo: "9876543210",
    email: "john@email.com",
    address: "123, ABC Street",
    bloodGroup: "O+",
    rollNo : "13245"
}

Insertion : 

SQL : insert into students (John Doe, 9876543210)
Mongo: db.students.insertOne({    name: "Jack",
mobileNo: "9876543211",
email: "jack@email.com",
address: "123, ABC Street",
bloodGroup: "O-",
rollNo : "13246"})

Commands / Queries

insert() : To insert new record
find() : To find records
update() : To update records
delete() : To delete records

db.students.find({name: "John Doe"})
